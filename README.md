Was a two part project | 
created 2 LWC | 
one was used for external site hosted via LWC | 
another was just an LWC component embedded in Opportunity page.

Steps to use:
  1. Add the Two LWC in your org
  2. Add the URLs to Trusted sites and All Sites
  3. Create custom fields
  4. Place the LWC on opportunity page

Key points:
  1. Used fetch as it is a weather api performs better saving time for backend call
