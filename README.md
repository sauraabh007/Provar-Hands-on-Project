**Ask was to create weather alerts and showcase errors if the weather was bad** | 
User Openweather API that is available for free |
created 2 LWC | 
one was used for external site hosted via LWC | 
another was just an LWC component embedded in Opportunity page.

  1. Used fetch as it is a weather api performs better saving time for backend call
